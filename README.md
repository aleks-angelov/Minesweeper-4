# Minesweeper - Python / Tkinter

### Personal leisure project (Spring 2014)

##### Description:
The goal of this series of four projects was to implement the popular Minesweeper game, bundled with Windows operating systems, in the four programming languages with which I was familiar at the time (C#, C++, Java, and Python). I also wanted to learn the basics of at least one standard Graphical User Interface toolkit that was available for each of these languages.
